# Store the day in a variable
for this question I use the input function to help me find the weekly day.
Ex:day = input("What is the day today: ")
if we lock to the example I first use the day name then I use the input function for the finding days

# Use conditional statements to recommend an activity based on the day.
for this question I use if and elif function to find the days and the day feeling in which day how felling 
Ex:if day == "monday":
    print("Start your week with a workout!")
elif day == "tuesday":
    print("It's a great day to read a book!")
elif day == "wednesday":
    print("Mid-week movie night!")
elif day == "thursday":
    print("Try a new recipe!")
elif day == "friday":
    print("Relax and enjoy the weekend!")
elif day == "saturday":
    print("Go for a hike!")
elif day == "sunday":
    print("Prepare for the week ahead with some self-care.")
else:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid day of the week!")
