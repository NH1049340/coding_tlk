# 01 Write a program that prints numbers from `1` to `10`, but **skips even numbers** using the `continue` statement.  
Ex: for number in range(1, 10, 2):
 print(number)
for this one I use so easy way to solve this problem I use the renge na d print for the result
and I add in range to start from 1 to 10 and skip one num.

# 02 Write a program that prints numbers from `1` to `10`, but **skips even numbers** using the `continue` statement.
Ex: for x in range(1, 11, 2):
    print(x)
for this problem I use 2 ways this one is a little define from other 
in this one I put the number from 1 to 11 and skip 2 num in a print I add X
