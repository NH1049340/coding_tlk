# Create a tuple with five different elements
Ex: my_tuple = (42, 3.14, "python", True, (1, 2, 3)
I made a tuple with five elements like number, num + point, python name, true and false, list of numbers.

# Print the entire tuple
Ex: print(my_tuple)
I use the print function to print  my tuple list.

# Access and print the third element
Ex: print(my_tuple[2])
I use again the print and I ask to print from  my tuple list the 2 element.

# Extract the nested tuple and print its first element
Ex: print(my_tuple[4][0])
again I use the print for giving me from the tuple list the 4 and 0 elements.
