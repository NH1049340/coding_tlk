# Ask the user to input two numbers
Ex: first_number = input("Enter first number: ")
second_number = input("Enter second number: ")
for thew first one I use the input and the comment for the first number.

# Swap the values using tuple unpacking
Ex: first_number, second_number = second_number, first_number
for this one I label the number first num and sec num then I did the number swapped.

# Print the swapped values
Ex: print(f"Swapped values: ({first_number}, {second_number})")
it the end I add the print for the result swapped the numbers.
