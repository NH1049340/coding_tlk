# Create a tuple with repeated values
Ex:fruits = ("apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "banana", "apple")
for this one I made the chart for the fruit.

# Ask the user to enter a fruit name
Ex: user_input = input("Enter a fruit name: ")
then I use the input for giving me the fruit name.

# Print how many times that fruit appears in the tuple
Ex: count = fruits.count(user_input)
print(f"The fruit '{user_input}' appears {count} time(s) in the tuple.")
then I made the table and asking for the fruit how time is that in the table.
