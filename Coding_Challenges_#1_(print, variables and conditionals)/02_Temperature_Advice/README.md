# Ask the user to enter the current temperature
for this one we ask from coding to creat the code for the temperature.
EX:print("please enter your temperature")
by this coding we can ask from user to add the temperature.

# Store the temperature in a variable
for his question I use the int and input to give me the answer.
Ex: temp=int(input("enter your temperature: "))
I use first the word which I need for this coding temp then i use the function int and input.

# Use conditional statements to give advice based on the temperature
 Ex:for this question I usr the function elif and if to give me the tem and the idea what should i have to do in weather.
if temp<10:
    print("it is cold outside, please wear warm clothes")
elif 10 <= temp <= 25:
    print("The weather is nice, Wear short-sleeved shirts!")
elif temp > 25:
    print("It is hot outside, Stay cool!")
