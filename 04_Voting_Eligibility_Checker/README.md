# ask the user to enter their age
for this question I ask the user to put the age then I tell the age which is age and over age.
Ex:print("Welcome to the Voting Eligibility Checker App!")

# Store the age in a variable
for this I use the function int and input to give me the age.
Ex:age = int(input("enter your age: "))

# Use conditional statements to check if the person is eligible to vote
for this question we can take the answer of our age I use for this question if and the elis function.
Ex: if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote!")
else:
    print("Sorry, You are not eligible to vote!")
