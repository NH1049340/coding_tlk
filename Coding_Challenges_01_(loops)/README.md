# Ask the user for a number n
Ex: n = int(input("Enter a number n: "))
for this one I use the int and input function to help me for finding numbers.

# Initialize the sum variable
Ex: total_sum = 0
for this one we have to first find the total then we have to do sum.

# Use a for loop to calculate the sum
Ex: for num in range(1, n + 1):
for this I use the renge.

# Add the current number to the total sum
Ex: print(f'The sum of all numbers from 1 to {n} is: {total_sum}')
for this I use the print and then i sum all the number from 1 to n and add 1.
