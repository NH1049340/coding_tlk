# Create the sets
Ex:set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
I creat the 2 set of the number set 1 or set 2.

# Calculate union
Ex:union = set1 | set2
print("Union:", union)
I use the union for set 1 or set 2 I use the print for the result.

# Calculate intersection
Ex:intersection = set1 & set2
print("Intersection:", intersection)
Then I use the intersection for the sets.

# Calculate difference (set1 - set2)
Ex:difference = set1 - set2
print("Difference (set1 - set2):", difference
Ex:Then I find the difference between the sets.
