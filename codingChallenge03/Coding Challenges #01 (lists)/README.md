# Create the list of students
Ex: students = [['Alice', 25, 'Physics'], ['Bob', 22, 'Chemistry'], ['Charlie', 24, 'Biology']]
this is a list for thr student with age and the subject.

# Update Bob's age and major
Ex: students[1] = ['Bob', 23, 'Mathematics']
for this one I change the Bob age and his subject chemistry to mathematics and 22 to 23.

# Print the updated students list
Ex: print(students)
I use the print function then I to print the student list.

# Find and print the name of the student studying 'Biology'
Ex: for student in students:
    if student[2] == 'Biology':
        print(student[0])
