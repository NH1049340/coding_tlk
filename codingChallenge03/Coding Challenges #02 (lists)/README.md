# Create the list of numbers
Ex: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
first i creat a list of number from 1 to 10.

# Create a list of even numbers
Ex: even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
then I make even number list to help me just give me even number.

# Create a list of squared numbers from the even_numbers list
Ex: squared_numbers = [num * num for num in even_numbers]
and this is a list of squared number it mean any even number make it squared.

# Print both lists
Ex: print("Even Numbers:", even_numbers)
print("Squared Numbers:", squared_numbers)
then I use the print function to print the result.
