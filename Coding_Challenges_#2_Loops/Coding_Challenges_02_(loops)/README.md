# Use a while loop to keep running until the guess is correct
Ex: while user_guess != random_number
for this I use the while then I put the guess for the user to add the num.

# Ask the user to make a guess
Ex:  user_guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
    if user_guess < random_number:
        print("Too low! Try again.")
    elif user_guess > random_number:
        print("Too high! Try again.")
for this one I add if elif and print for the result and for the num is too low and too high.

# 
EX: else:
        print('Correct! You win! ðŸŽ‰')
for this one I use the else and print for the winner.
