# Create the list of fruits
Ex: fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'orange']
first I made a list of fruit.

# Print the list sorted in ascending order
Ex: print("Sorted list (ascending):", sorted(fruits))
then I made the fruit list with alphabetical it meas before the apple was first now 2.

# Print the list sorted in descending order
Ex: print("Reversed list (descending):", sorted(fruits, reverse=True))
I change the function descending.
